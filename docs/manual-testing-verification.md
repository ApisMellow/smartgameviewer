# Manual Testing Verification for Board Rotation Feature

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Feature:** Board Rotation on Loop
**Binary Location:** `/Users/david/dev/smartgameviewer/.worktrees/board-rotation/target/release/smartgameviewer`

## Build Status

- **Release Build:** PASSED
- **Build Time:** 10.89s
- **Compiler:** rustc (release profile, optimized)

## Test Suite Results

- **Total Tests Run:** 21
- **Tests Passed:** 21
- **Tests Failed:** 0
- **Test Categories:**
  - Board View Tests: 3/3 passed
  - Game State Tests: 9/9 passed
  - Integration Tests: 2/2 passed
  - Parser Tests: 4/4 passed
  - UI Tests: 3/3 passed

### Key Test Coverage

1. **Rotation Logic:**
   - 0-degree rotation (identity)
   - 180-degree rotation (flip)
   - Rotation normalization (modulo 4)

2. **Game State Integration:**
   - Board rotates on loop
   - Multiple loop rotations cycle correctly (0° → 180° → 0°)
   - No rotation when looping is disabled

3. **End-to-End:**
   - SGF file loading with rotation support
   - Parser compatibility maintained

## Manual Testing Checklist

The following manual tests should be performed by a human operator using the TUI:

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run with AlphaGo game 4
./target/release/smartgameviewer examples/AlphaGo_LeeSedol_game4.sgf

# Or run with AlphaGo game 5
./target/release/smartgameviewer examples/AlphaGo_LeeSedol_game5.sgf
```

### Checklist Items

- [ ] **Initial Auto-play:** Game starts playing automatically at default speed
- [ ] **First Loop:** Let game play to the end and loop back to start
  - [ ] Verify board rotates 180° on loop (top-left stones now at bottom-right)
  - [ ] Verify board edges/corners are correctly transformed
  - [ ] Verify all stone positions are correctly rotated
- [ ] **Second Loop:** Let game loop again
  - [ ] Verify board returns to original orientation (0°)
  - [ ] Verify stones are back in original positions
- [ ] **Disable Looping:** Press 'L' to disable looping
  - [ ] Advance to end manually with Right arrow key
  - [ ] Verify board does NOT rotate when reaching end
  - [ ] Verify game stays at final position
- [ ] **Re-enable Looping:** Press 'L' to re-enable looping
  - [ ] Press Right arrow to advance past end
  - [ ] Verify board rotates 180° when looping occurs
- [ ] **Speed Testing:** Test rotation at different playback speeds
  - [ ] Press '1' for 1x speed - rotation should work
  - [ ] Press '2' for 2x speed - rotation should work
  - [ ] Press '3' for 3x speed - rotation should work
- [ ] **Visual Quality:** Verify rendering quality
  - [ ] Board grid lines display correctly in both orientations
  - [ ] Stone emojis (⚫⚪) render clearly in both orientations
  - [ ] Board background (wood color) is maintained
  - [ ] No visual glitches during rotation transition
- [ ] **Navigation:** Test manual navigation with rotation
  - [ ] Use Left/Right arrows to navigate forward/backward
  - [ ] Verify rotation state persists when navigating
  - [ ] Verify 'Home' and 'End' keys work correctly

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified

1. **src/board_view.rs** (NEW)
   - Created BoardView struct with rotation support
   - Implements coordinate transformation for 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
   - Size: 84 lines

2. **src/game.rs** (MODIFIED)
   - Added rotation field to GameState
   - Increments rotation by 180° on loop
   - Added rotation() getter method

3. **src/ui.rs** (MODIFIED)
   - Updated render_board to accept rotation parameter
   - Uses BoardView for coordinate transformation
   - Passes game.rotation() from render_game

4. **src/lib.rs** (MODIFIED)
   - Exported board_view module

### Test Files

1. **tests/board_view_tests.rs** (NEW) - 3 tests
2. **tests/game_tests.rs** (MODIFIED) - Added 3 rotation tests

## Technical Verification

### Code Quality
- All code follows existing project conventions
- No compiler warnings
- Clean separation of concerns (BoardView handles transformations)
- Rotation state encapsulated in GameState

### Architecture
- BoardView provides clean abstraction layer
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Performance
- Rotation is O(1) coordinate transformation
- No performance impact on rendering
- Release binary size: Minimal increase

## Readiness Status

**Status: READY FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION**

The implementation is complete and all automated tests pass. The release binary is built and ready for interactive manual testing. A human operator should run through the manual testing checklist above to verify the visual behavior and user experience.

### Next Steps

1. Human operator should perform manual testing using the checklist above
2. Document any issues or edge cases discovered
3. If all manual tests pass, feature is ready for merge
4. If issues are found, document and address them before merging

## Notes

- The feature uses a modulo-4 rotation system (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
- Currently increments by 180° per loop (alternates between 0° and 180°)
- Future enhancement could use 90° increments for more variation
- All coordinate transformations are handled in BoardView.get() method
- Rotation state is preserved during manual navigation
